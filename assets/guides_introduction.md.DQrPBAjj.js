To ensure stable operation even as the number of services grows, we made the following considerations and choices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Minimizing Inter-Service Impact</strong><br> As the number of services increases, if a change in one service affects others, it becomes difficult to isolate failures. Granite is designed to allow independent deployment of each service, ensuring that changes in one service don&#39;t affect others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build Optimization for Fast Deployment</strong><br> In an environment where deployments happen dozens of times a day, build speed directly impacts development speed. Granite uses <code>ESBuild</code> instead of the default Metro bundler to increase bundling speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bundle Optimization through Common Module Separation</strong><br> Including commonly used modules like <code>react-native</code> and <code>react</code> in each individual bundle unnecessarily increases bundle size. Granite defines a separate shared bundle and allows each service to import only the necessary modules from this common bundle. This results in lighter service bundles and faster loading times.</p></li></ul>',6)]))}const h=t(o,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,h as default};
